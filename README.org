** Mechanics
The idea of the game is that various spells are activated by certain key combinations.
These are based on a timer that waits for the next key once one is pressed.

There will be three base spells, perhaps 3 symbolising 3 elements and these three can be combined to make other spells.

I.e. For two key combinations:
|       | Air     | Water   | Fire   |
| Air   | Glide   |         |        |
| Water | Tornado | Barrier |        |
| Fire  |         |         | Meteor |

** Plan
*** Simple spell list GUI
*** Create a prototype level to test if the mechanics are fun
**** Need to think of some obstacles and or enemies and spells to resolve these
*** Create the first level
**** This level teaches mechanics (hopefully without text)
**** Think about what spells are required to complete the first level
***** Barrier 
***** Firebolt

*** Create a boss fight to showcase basic wizard abilities
